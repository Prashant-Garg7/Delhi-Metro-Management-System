# Delhi-Metro-Management-System

The objective of this project is to develop a simplified Delhi Metro Management System using C language, which simulates the essential functionalities of a metro system such as login, balance management, fare calculation, and ticket booking. This project aims to use basic programming concepts like loops, arrays, and conditional statements, making it a user-friendly mini-project.
# Features:
**Login System:** Secure login system with masked password entry using asterisks (*) for better security.
**Menu System**: A menu that allows users to:
- 1.Add balance.
- 2.View balance.
- 3.Book tickets.
- 4.Station Selection: Users can choose from Yellow, Pink, and Blue line metro stations.
- 5.Fare Calculation: Based on the userâ€™s selected starting and destination stations, the fare is calculated using predefined fare rules.

# Approach:
The system consists of a login feature, a main menu, and a metro line system. It uses loops and arrays to manage station listings and fares. Conditional statements like if-else are used to manage ticket booking and balance checking. The balance is deducted according to the fare calculated between stations, and the system ensures that the user has enough balance before booking a ticket.

# Key Modules:
- 1.Login System:
Implements a secure login using arrays for username and password.
Password entry is masked with asterisks (*).
- 2.Balance Management:
User can add balance to their account.
View current balance at any time.
- 3.Ticket Booking:
Users can select starting and destination stations from available lines (Yellow, Pink, Blue).
The system calculates the fare using predefined rates between stations.
Ticket is booked only if the user has sufficient balance.
- 4.Fare Calculation:
Uses loops and arrays to store and manage station data.
The fare is calculated based on the distance (or predefined fare rates) between the two stations selected by the user.
